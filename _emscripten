#                 spidermonkey from source. Any of these three is fine, as long as it's

# Recommendation: If you already have node installed, use that. If you can, also build
#                 spidermonkey from source as well to get more test coverage (node can't
#                 run all the tests due to node issue 1669). v8 is currently not recommended
